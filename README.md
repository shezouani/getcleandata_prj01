*Author: Said HEZOUANI <shezouani@gmail.com>*

The run_analysis.R script merges the given data sets located in the Dataset folder, makes few column transformations and computes a tidy data set with the mean measurement values per subject and per activity.

* **README.md** : this file...

* **CodeBook.md** : Describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that have been performed by the **run_analysis.R** script to clean up the data and to create the tidy data.

* **run_analysis.R** : R script performing the data cleaning and analysis. The script merges the given data sets located in the Dataset folder, makes few column transformations and computes a tidy data set with the mean measurement values per subject and per activity. Refer to the **CodeBook.md** for more details. 

* **Dataset** : The R script needs the UCI HAR Datasets to work. Unzip the **getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip** file and rename the data folder to **Dataset** so you have the README.txt at the following location **Dateset/README.txt**.
